# Twitter Cards Getting Started Bundle

Thank you for downloading the Twitter Cards getting started bundle!

## Player Card

In the `/player` path, you'll find sample code to set up a simple Player Card for your site.

The basic steps to deploy are:

- Unzip the contents into a publicly accessible path on your website
- Open the `page.html` file and ensure the `twitter:image`, `twitter:player` and `twitter:player:stream` values point to your server and file locations
- Update the content (`container.html`) that you're pointing to... don't use the sample video, please!
- Ensure all paths are specified as secure (https://)
- Test your URL

To test your experience, visit the Twitter [Cards Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
