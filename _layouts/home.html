 Research within the Newman Crew aims at improving understanding of active deformation and failure of the Earth's lithosphere in seismic and volcanic provinces, and its impact on society. Accordingly, the group's focus is on fields that have application in advancing our understanding of natural geologic hazards. 
</p>
<p>
Specically, in earthquake zones we study lithospheric forcing, earthquake faulting, failure mechanics, and factors controlling the recurrence of large events. In volcanic regions we illuminate understanding magmatic source physics and rheology through interpretation of ground deformation, tomography and volcano-induced seismicity. In studying these regions we utilize a broad spectrum of geophysical tools including seismology (source and path) and geodesy (mostly GPS, InSAR, and growingly seafloor geodesy).
