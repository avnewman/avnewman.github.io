## Course Information
### Course Objectives:
The purpose of this course is to provide you with an understanding of how the Earth works and how it affects you. As an inhabitant of Earth, it is important that you understand the processes that shape the landscape, cause natural hazards, influence climate change, and produce natural resources.  Knowledge of how the Earth works can also help you in your daily lives. For example, it is useful to be able to evaluate potential geologic hazards when buying a home, make informed decisions about the use and conservation of natural resources, and better appreciate features you might encounter in the mountains, at the beach, or when visiting a national park.

### Required Text:
* Grotzinger, J. & T. Jordan, Understanding Earth, 6th (or 7th) Ed., Freeman Press, 672 (650) pp., ISBN: 1429219513 (1464138745), 2010 (2014).

Because the material is largely duplicated between the two versions, students may use either of the above editions of this book. Chapter numbers described in the outline correspond to both versions.

I don't normally recommend E-editions for majors (great reference), but you may want to consider going entirely digital, and get some E-edition for this semester.
