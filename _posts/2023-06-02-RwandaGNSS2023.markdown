We are just now wrapping up GPS/GNSS Field work and some training along the Kivu Rift in Rwanda.

Before heading out to the field, we met individually with personnel from the Rwandan Mining Board ([RMB]), the Rwandan Environmental Management Agency ([REMA]), and the East African Institute for Fundamental Research ([EAIFR]).

We serviced our 7 continuous GNSS station, established one new campaign GNSS station, and performed a Magnetotelluric survey (MT), last part led by colleague Samer Naif.  More of our project can be read [here][KIVU].
