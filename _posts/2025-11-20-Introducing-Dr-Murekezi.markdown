Way to go Dr. [Derrick Murekezi][Derrick] for all your had work and 
successfully defending your PhD thesis today on "Magma-Assisted Extension and Crustal Deformation in the Kivu Rift: Geodetic Constraints on the 2021 Nyiragongo Dike Intrusion".

I wish you well as you start your work in the private sector.
