I was recently [awarded][Award] funding for an exciting new technical experiment to push the limits of what we can do with GNSS-Acoustic-based seafloor geodetic observations.  In the experiment, we are buying and deploying a new Wave Glider and 10 new transponders for deployment in the near-trench environment that are expected to be most responsible for large tsunamis.  

Over three years we will specifically be testing (1) deep-water measurements using lower frequency transponders than commonly used, (2) observations that include high gradients of change across the seafloor, and (3) the application of a mesh-network design that can dramatically reduce the cost of observations where dense deformation data are helpful.

The deployment will occur in June/July 2024 on the RV Sikuliaq, during the initial deployment of instrumentation in Alaska for the [Community Near-trench Geodetic Experiment][NTE]. We will commence observations then, with a second Wave Glider deployment planned for 2025.

My co-investigators are [Mark Zumberge][MZ] at UCSD-Scripps, and [Surui Xie][SX] at University of Houston.  We will soon be looking for a postdoc to manage the data processing associated with this experiment. 

A little more detail can be gained from the below image I pulled from the proposal.
